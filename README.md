# Codeclimate

[Codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) is tool Power uses to analyze code health. Similar to `overcommit`, `codeclimate` is run as a hook. However, instead of on a hook on local git commits like `overcommit`, `codeclimate` is executed as a [Github webhook](https://help.github.com/articles/about-webhooks/). This means that codeclimate results show up on Github PRs themselves:
